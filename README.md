## Description

Website to share projects I've worked on, my qualifications, and connect with people who are interested in working with me.

- I was motivated to make this project in preparation for entering the workforce.
- This project allowed me to practice my react skills as well as keeping my components organized.
- One of the challenges I faced with this project was adding functionality to the contact form that would send messages directly to my email.
- The implimentation was fairly simple and it was nice to be able to utilize my marketing skills in this project.

## Usage

Navigation is simple and intuitive. Cursor and hover effects were added to help with link visibility. The current section is bolded in the nav bar. Social links are available in the footer.

Images and titles link to the live project and the github icons link to the corresponding repos. Hover effects were added to help with visibility.

Once visitors submit the form, they will see a loading screen and when it completes, I will receive an email with their message. In turn they will receive an email letting them know their message sent and asking for 48 hours to respond.
